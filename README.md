🧠 AI Game Coach
This project is part of a broader AI Game Coach system. It uses motion analysis and computer vision to detect key moments in gameplay videos and automatically captures highlights for later analysis.
It also integrates with a player detection dataset for advanced insights.
Whether you're a casual player or an aspiring pro, this tool provides personalized coaching tailored to your gameplay style.

🎯 Key Features
🎥 Motion-Based Highlight Detection
Automatically identifies and saves high-action moments in gameplay footage.

📸 Automatic Frame Capture
